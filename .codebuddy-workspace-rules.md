# Workspace Rules - RECA Deep Scraping Project

## CodeBuddy Orchestra Framework

This workspace requires ALL development work to follow the CodeBuddy Orchestra persona framework.

### Mandatory Persona Usage

Before starting ANY work, you MUST:
1. Activate the appropriate CodeBuddy persona
2. Announce the activation in your response
3. Follow the persona's specific approach and language
4. Document decisions from that persona's perspective

### Persona-Phase Mapping

- **Phase 1: CSV Export** → `Activating CodeBuddy Debugger...`
- **Phase 2: Email Testing** → `Activating CodeBuddy Implementation Planner...`
- **Phase 3: Full Enrichment** → `Activating CodeBuddy Implementation Planner...`
- **Phase 4: Data Validation** → `Activating CodeBuddy Validator...`
- **Phase 5: Database Ingestion** → `Activating CodeBuddy Project Manager...`
- **Phase 6: Production Deployment** → `Activating CodeBuddy Architect...`

### Enforcement

- Commits without persona references will be rejected
- PRs must include persona decision documentation
- Issues must track which persona is addressing each task
- All code reviews check for persona consistency

### Project Context

This is a RECA (Real Estate Council of Alberta) agent scraping project. We have:
- ✅ 20,447 agents scraped to JSON
- ❌ No CSV export (blocking issue)

Remember: Always work within the CodeBuddy Orchestra framework!
